My attempt at recreating *Ball Defender*, a game we played on a long United Airlines London --> Los Angeles trip.
The original was developped by *Ensemble Media*. Turns out there's a lot of similar games on the internet.
I tried to correct some of the bugs present in *Ball Defender*, while adding some of my own personal favorite.

My attempts to put some juicy visual/sound effects turned **ABHD** into a game in the "ADHD trap" genre. Oops.


## Todo, one day
